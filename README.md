# D.I.G.I.D
In This repository we aim to create a multifonctinnal system for digital identification.

FACIAL IDENTITY:
Face detection stops as its name suggests at detection. The algorithm detects a face but does not identify it, unlike facial recognition. Facial recognition classifies a detected face (even if there are other ways to do a classification, for example a comparison of vectors).
