FACIAL IDENTITY:
Face detection stops as its name suggests at detection. The algorithm detects a face but does not identify it, unlike facial recognition. Facial recognition classifies a detected face (even if there are other ways to do a classification, for example a comparison of vectors).

STORING ID:
think of a way to store biometric information in a decentralized and secure way thanks to blockchain, hashes and public key cryptography.
